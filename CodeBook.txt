Getting and Cleaning Data
Week 4 Project

==================================================

This R script uses data from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

==================================================

Variables used and reasoning:

Section 2:
Each variable is the same name as the text file the data is from.
activity_labels contains "activity_labels.txt".
features contains "features.txt".
subject_test contains "subject_test.txt".
ETC.

Section 3:
Updating the x_test and x_train variables by removing the spaces and replacing with "s". 
tc1 and tc2 use the textConnection function to read and update the text in x_test and x_train.

Section 4:
features_unlist is an unlisted version of the original features variable. This will be used as the column names in the x_test and x_train datasets.
names is used to update column names for y_test, y_train, subject_test, and subject_train.

Section 5: 
x_test_y_test_subject_test contains the cbind data from subject_test, y_test, and x_test.

Section 6: 
x_train_y_train_subject_train contains the cbind data from subject_train, y_train, and x_train.

Section 7: 
combined_test_train is the combined dataset of all the test and train data.

Section 8:
activity_labels gets two additional columns for descriptive purposes.

Section 9:
combined_mean_std contains only columns that contain "mean()" and "std()".

Section 10:
combined_activity joins combined_test_train and activity_labels to include the descriptive names of activities.

Section 11:
combined_all_variables_mean groups by subject and activity to calculate the means of every single column name.
